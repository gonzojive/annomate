This is an HTML5/Javascript/SVG tool for collectively annotating
images.  It will include means of adding point-based annotations
(landmarks), as well as pixel-baased annotations (segmentations),
along with associated labels.

Included is some static HTML/Javascript stuff along with a Common Lisp
restful web server that pretty much just dumps annotations sent from
the client to disk.
